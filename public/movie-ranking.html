<h1>The Best Movies According to Tommy</h1>
<h2>My top 4 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>Tells a realistic story of love with futuristic (yet believable) technology aspects.</p>
<h3>Seven Psychopaths</h3>
<p>I can't find a more smooth dialouge and script with the most impressive casting and dynamic acting.</p>
<h3>Little Miss Sunshine</h3>
<p>Black comedy at its finest, the most disfuntional family with some of the worst luck are stuck together to realise all they need is each other</p>
<h3>The lord of the rings: The fellowship of the ring</h3>
<p>My favourite of the trilogy. Such an adventure. Nuff said</p>
